First Experience with Multiplayer VR Development Using NormCore
Overview:
This project is my first foray into developing a multiplayer VR game with NormCore. Initially, everything seemed straightforward, but as I added custom data syncing, the complexity increased. My goal was to implement as many features as possible within a week, dedicating about 5 hours daily. This limited timeframe emphasized the importance of focusing on core gameplay features rather than spending excessive hours on non-essential mechanics.

Challenges:

IK Setup and Syncing Values:
Syncing custom data and handling IK across multiple players required significant adjustment. While not extremely difficult, it required a keen understanding of multiplayer synchronization principles.

Managing Scope:
I initially attempted to implement numerous mechanics but soon realized that prioritizing core features over optional elements was essential. This shift in focus helped streamline development.

Key Learnings:

Multiplayer Logic Impact:
With limited experience in both VR and multiplayer, this project was invaluable for understanding the interconnectedness of game logic across multiple players. It highlighted the importance of anticipating how every player's actions and data affect others.
